## ðŸ”§ Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit with production values

# Frontend  
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.production
# Edit with production values
```

### 2. Docker Deployment
```bash
# Simple deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- Health checks: `/health` and `/api/status`
- Log monitoring: Container logs via `docker-compose logs`
- Performance: Built-in performance utilities
- Uptime: External monitoring service recommended

### 4. Security Verification
- [ ] SSL certificates installed (for production domain)
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Rate limiting tested
- [ ] CORS origins verified

### 5. Performance Testing
```bash
# Load testing (example with Apache Bench)
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:5000/health

# Memory usage monitoring
docker stats

# Database performance
docker exec mongodb mongo --eval "db.stats()"
```

## ðŸ“Š Production Metrics

### Performance Targets
- API response time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Frontend load time: < 3 seconds
- Database query time: < 100ms
- Error rate: < 1%
- Uptime: > 99.9%

### Monitoring Alerts
